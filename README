Hi,

This is a URL extractor web application developed using Django web framework.
It only finds link URLs under given URL to crawl. 

Setup:
	Assuming you have a running Django environment, you only need to install
	two extra modules:
	> sudo easy_install pip (If you have not installed pip before)
	> sudo pip install BeautifulSoup
	> sudo pip install httplib2

Running:
	At the project root folder, run
	> python manage.py runserver

Tested on MacOS and Linux.
	Python version : 2.7.10 (MacOS High Sierra)
	Python version : 2.7.13 (Fedora 25)
	Django version : 1.11.7


Have a nice crawling:)
